# Carbon offset calculator app

Welcome to my Carbon Offset Calculator app! It is still a work in progress, so I welcome any feedback.Please note that you have to run npm install seperately in the Calculator-Back-End folder and again in the Calculator-Front-End folder. PLEASE DO NOT run npm install in the Carbon-Offset-Calculator parent folder.

## To run the back-end of this app:

1. cd into Calculator-Back-End
2. run npm install
3. run npm run dev

I believe my backend is mostly completed and functioning well now.

## To run the front-end of this app:

1. cd into Calculator-Front-End
2. run npm install
3. run npm run dev
4. Fill out form and submit
